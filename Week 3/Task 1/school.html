                <!-- A brief story of our school -->
                <p>Nile's International School was founded in 2023 out of a deep love for teaching and a passion for helping children grow into the best verssions of themselves. We started small, offering only daycare and after school program. Soon after, we expanded into Kindergarten, providing a strong foundation for early learning. As time went on and families entrusted us with their children, we grew into a full primary schoold, and now proudly offer education up to secondary level.  
                </p>
                <p>From these humble beginnings, Nile's International school has become a place where learning is top-notch, values are nutured and students are trained to succeed academically and in life. Today, we are recognized across Lagos as a school of excellence and growth.</p>
